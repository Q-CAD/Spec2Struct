## Dataset
The datamodule expects crystal data in JSON format, structured as a list of dictionaries with the following keys:
```
[
    ...
    {
        'structure_id'      : str,
        'positions'         : list of (N, 3),
        'cell'              : list of (3, 3),
        'atomic_numbers'    : list of (N),
        'y'                 : list of (N, M)
    }
    ...
]
```
where `y` is the node-level features.

See below on how to download the MP-DOS dataset.

## Sample Run
To train a diffusion model with CFG (classifier-free guidance) on the MP-DOS dataset, first take a look at the config file `configs/dos_cfg.yml`, then run
```
python run_diffusion_CFG.py
```
The training progress is tracked using `wandb`. If you're running it for the first time, you may need to sign in.


## Generation
Since we are using classifier-free guidance, we are still able to do unconditional generation, that is, generating structures without input DOS information. To do so, try
```
python generate_CFG_unconditional.py --root_path=<PATH/TO/CKPT>
```

For conditional generation, we need to feed the model the DOS information we want to condition the generation on. As an example, we can try to reconstruct the MP-DOS test split:

```
python generate_CFG_conditional.py --root_path=<PATH/TO/CKPT>
```

Generated structures will be saved to a timestamped folder in `structures/`.

## Visualization
Please refer to `plot_dos.ipynb` on a possible approach to visualize the generated structures' DOS against the ground truth.
